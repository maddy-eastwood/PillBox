# PillBox

Welcome to PillBox!

This game is inspired by an old, classic game called Pillbox. A playing field is randomly generated, containing a mountain between two bases. The goal is to choose an angle and speed with which to fire your bullet to accurately hit the other player's base. If you succeed, you gain 100 points, and a new playing field is generated. The players can determine how long they want to play and can select Quit or Restart if they wish to finish or start over.

Note: I coded this game through PyCharm using the Pygame module and pushed the code to GitHub once finished.
